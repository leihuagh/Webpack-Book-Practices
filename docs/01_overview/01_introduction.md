[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) simplifies web development by solving a fundamental problem: bundling. It takes in various assets, such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and transforms them into a format thatâ€™s convenient to consume through a browser. Doing this well takes a significant amount of pain away from web development.

It's not the easiest tool to learn due to its configuration-driven approach, but it's incredibly powerful. The purpose of this guide is to help you get started with webpack and then go beyond the basics.
